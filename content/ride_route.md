# Getting There.

## So, where does the road take us on our way to Provincetown?

It takes us from Longwood (in Boston), through several very scenic Massachussetsey areas:
- On bike paths through and out of Metro Boston
- Through couple fairly pretty suburban towns just outside of the city
- Past like 10 cute farms with roadside stands selling things such as ice cream and fresh radishes
- Through some improbably quiet towns with horrible food options and really attractive swimming spots
- Down to some more sleepy towns, each smelling increasingly more like it's close to an ocean
- Through Onset (the first gorgeous beach town of the ride), where there's finally _great_ food. Clamcakes!
- Along a shipping canal, on a quiet tow path
- Over a bridge and through a traffic circle so large that other traffic circles have started spawning off the sides of it. Truly a marvel of modern infrastructure, and containing one of three (3!) cyclist-only rotaries we will see on the trip.
- Along the other side of the shipping canal, on another quiet tow path
- To the campground for night one
- Through a bunch of totally sick marshes, brackish inlets, and cranberry bogs.
- To brunch.
- Down a bunch of verrrry narrow roads on the bay side of the penninsula
- Up to, and I shit you not **20-odd miles of continuous protected bike path**
- Over some big hills to a beautiful, often frigid beach
- [Optional challenge section 1: Old King's Highway]
- Over some other big hills (what the hell are these doing at the end of a peninsula which is like 12 feet wide?) with increasingly tempting ocean views
- [Optional challenge section 2: Scrimshaw Road Hill]
- Last big hill, I promise. Look to your right or you'll miss the vineyard!
- Down, and I also shit you not, a country road with oyster shells for a shoulder
- Into Provincetown! You made it!

## That sounds cool but you didn't answer my actual question.

Yeah, those were a lot of words, so let me put numbers to them. Here's our GPS paths for [day 1](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/27740808/) and [day 2](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/21800202), last year. Here's the short version of the [cue sheet](./maps/SinglePageCueSheet.pdf) for reference&mdash;we will be navigating off (an updated) one of these on the ride. New and improved 2021-spec full sheet coming soon!

## This cue sheet seems intimidating.

I get that! If you're not used to group rides, it's probably a bother. I'm used to group rides and it's still a bother for me tbqh. The good news is you're going to be riding with people who know how to use this, and usually groups form up around a de facto navigator.

On the topic of maps, though, let me say two things:
1. Your phone still works on the cape (though trust me, you want to set it to Do Not Disturb), and your phone GPS does too. If you're on a flip phone or something, that's super badass, and you can probably use that as an icebreaker when you ask for directions.
2. I really super duper recommend [Rubel BikeMaps](https://www.bikemaps.com/) and especially their [Cape Cod map](https://www.evmaplink.com/Cape_Cod_The_Islands_and_North_Shore_Road_and_Bi_p/2062407m.htm), which is now waterproof! Sure, your phone could _probably_ show you where the nearest ice cream store or nearby trail (essential for safety reasons) is, but like, editorial content is so much better.

Seriously, it's fine. Take a deep breath and buy the Rubel map from basically any bike shop in MA that's worth going to.

**Hope this helps - happy trails!**
