It should not move.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Chain                   | Should be properly lubed and tensioned        | For bikes with no chain tensioner - grab the chain above the stay and try to move it up and down. It should not be completely taut, but should not move more than 3/4" top to bottom.<br><br>Ride the bike around the block. Does your chain make a noise? Lube that fucker with real bike lube.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Derailleurs, if present | Should traverse the entire range of the gears | With the bike in a stand or holding up the rear wheel, pedal the bike manually. For each shifter:<br>- shift to the very bottom of the gear range<br>- shift to the very top of the gear range<br>- shift back to the middle (big front ring if you're running a double up front)<br>The derailleurs should move easily, and the chain should engage with each of your gears without a fight.<br><br>If you have exposed shift cables (i.e. just the metal cable without plastic housing is exposed for more than a couple inches) at no point should they be so loose that they're flopping around.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Shifters, if present    | Should engage with gears properly             | Ride your bike around the block. If you have a newer bike or one with an internally geared hub (fat thing in the back), you have indexed shifting. Each click of your shifter should smoothly move you up or down a gear. If your drivetrain rattles for a few seconds before shifting, no bueno.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Cranks + bottom bracket | Should be properly installed and not damaged  | With your bike on the ground:<br>- hold the frame and try to laterally shake the shit out of your drive-side (with the chain) crank arm<br>- do the same thing to the other arm<br>- grab both arms and try to move them radially relative to each other<br>- inspect the arms for cracks or other damage<br>If either of the arms wiggle relative to the frame or each other, no bueno.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| All brakes              | Should have proper cable pull                 | With your bike in a stand or the wheels elevated:<br>- Spin the wheel freely.

If there is exposed brake cable, and it is loose to where it's floppy, no bueno.<br><br>Ride your bike around the block.<br>- Pull the back brake lever until it just about skids the wheel.<br>- Do the same for the front.<br>Your brake lever should not be touching the handlebars at any time. Ideally it shouldn't need to move that far.                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Tires                   | Should be in good shape, not a weird size     | Normal sizes of tire that you can expect to be sold at shops are:<br>- 27 x 1-1/4<br>- 700c x 23-32<br>- 26" x 1.75, 1.90 or 2.xx (MUST BE DECIMAL NO FRACTIONS)<br>If your tire is any different size, consider bringing a spare tire. Even with a regular size, consider bringing a spare tire. Do not ride on knobbly tires unless you want to piss yourself off with the constant buzzing and leech energy from your legs for no reason.<br><br>Rotate the wheel and observe the sidewall and tread:<br>- Sidewall should have no scrapes or exposed threads<br>- There should be no visible bald spots in your tread<br>- There should not be random shit stuck in your tread<br>- Tire should sit on wheel evenly (no change in height when viewed from the side) when inflated to max pressure |
