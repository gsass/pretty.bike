# Hey.
Here is a packing list, and also some thoughts on hauling the things you've packed.

This advice is based on my experience as a somewhat casual cyclist who likes things such as "comfort" and "not having everyone see my jiggle jello", and your experience/needs might be different. If you're like, really hardcore, or you've taken up strict minimalism, or your feet get really cold, or something else, absolutely do amend this plan to suit your needs. I would advise over-packing and paring down if this is your first time riding; it sucks to ride a heavy bike but it sucks way more to be frigid/damp, sunburnt/fixing a flat in full sun, or any other hell combo that lack of prep can lead to.

## Packing It
I always think I pack kinda heavy, but also I see people who pack a lot more stuff than I do. I would treat this as a place to start, and I try to note places where you can opt for an alternative solution.

### Personal Packing List
**Essential Miscellania**
- Various straps, nets, and bungees - I always carry 1 big bungee, and I always find it useful
- Voile Straps, optionally - these are like giant ski straps and work great if you need to *tightly* lash a thing to another thing.
- 1 big-ass sack of tasty treats - you are going to be hungry all day otherwise and I don't want to hear you whine

**Camping**
- 1 tent, or hammock with mosquito netting
- 1 ground cover, if using a tent
- 1 rain cover, if your tent doesn't have it built in
- 1 sleeping bag which can keep you warm in 50 degree weather
- 1 set hammock straps, if hanging a hammock
- 1 set nice rain cover/tent stakes

**Clothing**
I (George) prefer rocking shell shorts over padding liners, because I like looking casual/non-lycra and I like some padding between my cheeks and the saddle. I assume that unless you're a real hardass you will like padding between your buns and the saddle too. If you already have kit (meaning lycra road-riding clothes), you probably feel differently. Don't buy liners if you have kit already; you probably like kit. Don't buy kit unless you like being in kit.

- 1 pair shell shorts for cycling (unless using a bib/padded shorts)
- 2 padded liners (or two bibs/shorts - unless you're hardcore and wash/dry your one pair of shorts nightly, I guess)
- 2 tees you don’t mind sweating through entirely (synthetic smells worse but chafes less)
- 1 tee for camping/sleeping
- 1 pair macrame gloves (or lesser, non-macrame gloves)
- 1 bike cap or ball cap - these are so clutch once the going gets sweaty
- 3 pairs running socks or other socks which you know don't chafe
- 1 pair shoes you can bike in - see appendix
- 1 pair swim shorts/swimsuit
- 1 pair heaux-ass shorts which make people want to buy you a DRANK (this might be a "me" thing)
- 1 pair sunglasses + case
- 2 pairs underwear
- 1 pair shoes for camp/if your bike shoes get soaked (see appendix)
- 2 shirts nice enough to get into a restaurant with ("t-shirt without holes" or better)
- 1 packable hooded rain jacket (or poncho, if you love that greenhouse STANK feeling)
- 1 compression sack/plastic bag for dirty laundry

**Hygeine**
- 1 face/hand towel
- 1 camp towel (body size)
- 1 toiletry kit (if you use Bronner's soap it's also a dishwashing and laundry kit!)
- 1 big tube of sunscreen (I advise "hella SPF" regardless of your complexion)
- 1 tube of anti-junk-chafing cream (I like "Butt'r", and there's a more coochie-friendly version for ladies)
- 1 small body glide (to prevent non-junk chafing)
- 1 small first-aid kit (someone in the breakdown crew will have a full kit, but a couple band-aids + sterile wipes weigh like 10 grams so just do it.)
- A couple grocery bags for trash reasons (you can get these at an actual grocery store en-route I guess)

**Electronixxx**
- 1 loud-ass waterproof speaker to blast the jams (optional but very clutch)
- 1 battery pack which can charge your phone (also optional but clutch)
- Chargers which can charge your lights and phone (NOT OPTIONAL)
- 1 walkie talkie if you want it; we will provide

**Kitchenware**
- 1 small folding knife
- 1 camp mug
- 1 cheapish gas stove + gas can, if you want tea/pourover in the morning
- Tea/Coffee, if you want it
- 2 full-size bidons or other hydration solution (see appendix)
- More emergency snacks

**Tools**
- 1 lighter, for safety
- 1 bike tool which you can use to pull your wheels
- 1 spare tube which fits your tires (emphatically NOT OPTIONAL)
- 1 saddle rain cover if you have a fancy saddle
- Possibly more tools, read on if curious

### Ride Leader/Medic/Mechanic packing list
Individual riders can carry these things too (especially if they own them!) but it's not a hard requirement. Folks who are more familiar with the ride will chat in advance and make sure we have enough of these to go around.
- 1 bike repair kit (allen keys, lil wrench, sockets, pliers/cable cutters, nuts+bolts, various zipties, patch kit, lube, chain tool, electrical tape)
- 1 bike pump or inflater with hella cartridges
- 1 lock, possibly with a corral cable
- 1 small medical kit (incl. antihistamines, tweezers, more than band-aids and a dream)

## Hauling it
Thankfully, people have needed to carry crap on their bicycles since forever, so there’s plenty options for doing it. Here are the ones I’ve seen work.

*...actually before we go there, let me stop you and say **absolutely do not try to do this ride in a backpack**. Hydration sack mini-backpacks are fine but unless you want to well and truly enter the next level of chafing, blistering, and body acne, stay the absolute whoo-hah away from that Jansport you're eyeing. I will have no sympathy if you try to backpack this ride. None. Do not do this. Anyway,*

**Panniers!** For road rides on a bike that can easily fit regular-style racks on the back/front you really can’t beat some damn panniers. I like Axiom Stormfronts, Koki grocery panniers, and Ortliebs. Those all cost tall money, so I would also check with REI/Craigslist for deals. REI will apparently let you rent some gear; idk if panniers are included. If you want to be cute, you can go for four matching Swift panniers, and we will all Insta your bike instead of ours and call it a day.

**Frame bags/strapping compression sacks to your bike.** Frame bags work super great, and are the lightest/potentially cheapest way to carry your gear, but have two caveats. First, attachment is critical: if your load swings even slightly it will piss you off so much that you will buy a seatpost bag support/front rack in the middle of the ride. This isn't a problem with dedicated frame bags but I highly advise you test ride (more than ten miles) with your load if you're taking this route. Second, application-specific solutions like a frame bag or "ass rocket" seat bag might be harder to pack on account of their uh, unique shape.

I’ve personally used a Jandd “ascent bag” (basically a compression sack with straps around the outside) held to a pannier with some Voile straps, and I love the cheapass “XL Frame Bag” and “Regular-Ass Frame Bag” from Jandd (they are cheap as hell). I've seen a rider fit a home-made frame bag through his entire front triangle plus run a compression bindle on a seatpost rack, and he got through the ride just fine.

**Wald 137 Basket full of crap.** The Wald 137 (sometimes aka Wald 1372) is a steel-frame bike basket made in the USA and it is cheap as hell but somehow still extremely good, and even scientists are still trying to figure out why. I think it's because they haven’t updated the design for 60 years at least. If you just want to get things around and don’t mind having to really use your forearms, it is entirely possible to pile most of your crap in a backpack/gym bag, throw it in a Wald, throw some more crap in a frame bag/compession sack, and be done.

### Should I share, borrow, or buy?
You’re going to be riding with people, through relatively populated places. While there’s some things everyone needs for themselves (e.g. spare tube, junk cream), there's other stuff which can be shared (e.g. don't bring two tents if you're a couple, but you knew that), borrowed (I will have some packing gear, others might too, I may or may not set up a place where people can swap/request stuff), or bought en-route (e.g. macrame gloves and bike caps, on day 2, when you realize why I took the time to call out those two specific items above). This list of gear is probably pretty intimidating to a first-time rider, and I get that, and I'm sorry, and I'm here to help.

## This is the Appendix
So ya, lots of options, lots of ideas. Here's some more thoughts about other ideas people have.

### On the topic of shoes
You can do this ride in regular sneakers, and you can do it in clipless (which is just the worst misnomer jfc) bike shoes. The latter isn't required; I rode clipless for the first few rides and it reduced foot fatigue a bit but I'm not fast, and clipless didn't make me faster, so I swapped back to plain sneakers.

What does work (for me):
- Closed toe shoes. Two people have done this ride in Tevas/Chaco style sandals, so it's possible to do it in sandals, but consider if you will: not stepping into the skudge which you might see on the shoulder of a suburban road. I'd reccomend closed toes but you can do you if you're that kinda buckaroo.
- Stiff soles. You can get a lot of the value of clipless shoes without installing clips (again, worst misnomer, jfc etc) in them. Stiffer soles let you put down more power without tiring out your arches or ankles. Fresh skate shoes and running shoes with full padding are popular and work well.
- Flat soles. If you're not comfortable walking in clippity-clop road shoes, this is not the weekend to try them out. Fast people, you do you (y'all do y'all?).
- Good socks and foot powder.

### On the topic of hydration
I once rode this ride with only one water bottle and I absolutely hated that, so I recommend having 2L of water capacity or more. I like:
- Two big bike botles (in the packing list), or
- A hydration bag. I like the fannypack format but the slim backpack format also works well.
