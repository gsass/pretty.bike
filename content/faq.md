# We all have questions.

And, it seems like we're all looking to Jim to answer them. Seems like he's occupied, so let me take a crack at the...
## FAQ.

### What is this?

This is the website for the Pretty Ride: a two-day ride from Boston to Provincetown. This year's ride dates are Saturday June 4th to Monday June 6th, 2022.

### The Pretty Ride?

Yep! Technically it's "The Pretty Jimmy Ride, brought to you by ARC Reliable Shaft Drive", a name we dreamed up on one very hot ride full of smack talk and joking around. Explaining the joke would ruin it, but feel free to laugh anyway.

The idea for this ride started around 2015 or so, when the weather was nice and George + Simon got tipped off to this whole giant peninsula they could ride their bikes down. Over the years it's evolved into an all-levels social bike tour down the back roads of Eastern MA and Cape Cod.

### How long is that?

About 150 miles, split 85/65 between two days. You can learn more on the "maps" page.

### When do we roll out?

We usually leave around 8-10am on Saturday and most people take a Monday ferry back from Provincetown. You really need to rush on the second day to get the last Sunday night ferry back so we recommend staying until Monday if you can swing a day off work.

### Cool. How do I sign up?

Signups for 2022 are available by email request for now, so fill in this form: https://forms.gle/9PvPqgUb6gezStPB6 and email George.

### I am signed up. What should I be doing now?

The things which every rider should do are:
- Submit your info via the entry form (not linked here b/c signups are closed).
- Pay the entry fee ($40 all-inclusive).
- Train up! Details in the Training Schedule.
- Make sure your bike is ticking like clockwork. See the Mechanical Checklist and/or "Shakedown Ride" section of the Training Schedule.
- Make sure you've got the gear you need to ride, camp, and enjoy your time on the cape! The Packing List is probably what you want.

See you on the ride! _(or sooner, just let us know)_

### What kind of shoes should I wear? Do I need to go clipless?
You can do this ride in regular sneakers, and you can do it in clipless (which is just the worst misnomer jfc) bike shoes. The latter isn't required; I rode clipless for the first few rides and it reduced foot fatigue a bit but I'm not fast, and clipless didn't make me faster, so I swapped back to plain sneakers.

What does work (for me):
- Closed toe shoes. Two people have done this ride in Tevas/Chaco style sandals, so it's possible to do it in sandals, but consider if you will: not stepping into the skudge which you might see on the shoulder of a suburban road. I'd reccomend closed toes but you can do you if you're that kinda buckaroo.
- Stiff soles. You can get a lot of the value of clipless shoes without installing clips (again, worst misnomer, jfc etc) in them. Stiffer soles let you put down more power without tiring out your arches or ankles. Fresh skate shoes and running shoes with full padding are popular and work well.
- Flat soles. If you're not comfortable walking in clippity-clop road shoes, this is not the weekend to try them out. Fast people, you do you (y'all do y'all?).
- Good socks and foot powder.

### I'm so thirsty right now. Also I was wondering how to hydrate on the ride.
I once rode this ride with only one water bottle and I absolutely hated having to stop a dozen times a day for refills, so I recommend having 2L of water capacity or more. I like:
- Two big bike botles (in the packing list), or
- A hydration bladder such as the kind hikers like. I like the fannypack format but the slim backpack format also works well.

### I have other questions.
