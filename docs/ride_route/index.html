<p><img src="../img/arrival.png" alt="Artist's depiction of a cyclist arriving in Provincetown"></p>
<h2>So, where does the road take us on our way to Provincetown?</h2>
<p>It takes us from Longwood (in Boston), through several very scenic Massachussetsey areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>On bike paths through and out of Metro Boston</li>
<li>Through some pretty suburbs in Metro South, and across a golf course</li>
<li>Past like 10 cute farms with roadside stands selling things such as ice cream and fresh radishes</li>
<li>Through some (also pretty) towns with lackluster food options but great swimming spots</li>
<li>Down to Snapping Turtle Park and then (please don't hate me) the one incredibly bike-unfriendly town on this ride
<ul>
<li>Decent roads, terrible people. Unclear what's happening here!</li>
<li>Sadly it's very hard to route away from this liminal space, but</li>
<li>we have made it safely through this town before and will do it again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Through Onset (the first gorgeous beach town of the ride), where there's finally <em>great</em> food. Clamcakes!</li>
<li>Along a shipping canal, on a quiet tow path</li>
<li>Over a bridge and through a traffic circle so large that other traffic circles have started spawning off the sides of it. Truly a marvel of modern infrastructure, and containing one of three (3!) cyclist-only rotaries we will see on the trip.</li>
<li>Along the other side of the shipping canal, on another quiet tow path</li>
<li>To the campground for night one</li>
<li>Through a bunch of totally sick marshes, brackish inlets, and cranberry bogs.</li>
<li><strong>Brunch</strong> in Yarmouth</li>
<li>Down a bunch of verrrry narrow roads on the bay side of the penninsula</li>
<li>Up to, and I shit you not <strong>20-odd miles of continuous protected bike path</strong></li>
<li>Over some big hills to a beautiful, often frigid beach</li>
<li><em>Optional challenge section 1: Old King's Highway</em></li>
<li>Over some other big hills (what the hell are these doing at the end of a peninsula which is like 12 feet wide?) with increasingly tempting ocean views</li>
<li><em>Optional challenge section 2: Scrimshaw Road Hill</em></li>
<li>Last big hill, I promise. Look to your right or you'll miss the vineyard!</li>
<li>Down, and I also shit you not, a country road with oyster shells for a shoulder</li>
<li>Into Provincetown! You made it!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're wondering &quot;how far is the ride?, or &quot;are there hills?,&quot; peek at our GPS tracks for last year - <a href="https://ridewithgps.com/routes/27740808/">day one</a> and <a href="https://ridewithgps.com/routes/21800202">day 2</a>.</p>
<h2>That all sounds cool but you didn't answer my actual question.</h2>
<p>Yeah, those were a lot of words, but none of them help you do the ride, huh. During the ride, we're going to navigate off cue sheets (you can also use a GPS but cue sheets don't require batteries). I can't say enough good things about Amy's map planning, nor will I downplay what hard work it is - the cue sheets are super clear, disambiguate weird intersections, note important landmarks such as &quot;the good ice cream shop&quot; and &quot;check out this lake; it's cool&quot;, and are just extremely well-done. Thanks Amy!</p>
<p><strong>Here are the cue sheets for <a href="./content/maps/Cue%20Sheet%20Day%201.pdf">day 1</a> and <a href="./content/maps/Cue%20Sheet%20Day%202.pdf">day 2</a>.</strong></p>
<p>If you're an ultralight packer and don't need cute lil diagrams for how to handle the more &quot;historic&quot; intersections along the way, here's the <a href="./content/maps/SinglePageCueSheet.pdf">short version</a>.</p>
<h2>This cue sheet seems intimidating.</h2>
<p>I get that! If you're not used to group rides, it's probably a bother. I'm used to group rides and it's still a bother for me tbqh. The good news is you're going to be riding with people who know how to use this, and usually groups form up around a de facto navigator.</p>
<p>If you want a backup/extra map, though:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your phone still works on the cape (though trust me, you want to set it to Do Not Disturb), and your phone GPS does too. If you're on a flip phone or something, that's super badass, and you can probably use that as an icebreaker when you ask for directions.</li>
<li>I really super duper recommend <a href="https://www.bikemaps.com/">Rubel BikeMaps</a> and especially their <a href="https://www.evmaplink.com/Cape_Cod_The_Islands_and_North_Shore_Road_and_Bi_p/2062407m.htm">Cape Cod map</a>, which is now waterproof! Sure, your phone could <em>probably</em> show you where the nearest ice cream store or nearby trail (essential for safety reasons) is, but like, editorial content is so much better.</li>
</ol>
<p>Seriously, it's fine. Take a deep breath and buy the Rubel map from basically any bike shop in MA that's worth going to.</p>
<p><strong>Hope this helps - happy trails!</strong></p>
